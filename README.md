# vioplot development repository

## Migration

This is a development branch of the vioplot 0.3 release. The package has been migrated to:

https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplot

## Installation


To get the current released version from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("vioplot")
```

To get the modified version from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx")
```

## Running

See the relevant vignette for more details:

* Customising colour and shape with scalar inputs or vectors applied separately to each violin.

https://rawgit.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx/master/vignettes/violin_customisation.html

* Formula input enabled with S3 methods.

https://rawgit.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx/master/vignettes/violin_formulae.html

* Control of violin area for proportional widths

https://rawgit.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx/master/vignettes/violin_area.html

* Control of the y-axis including disabling labels and log-scale

https://rawgit.com/TomKellyGenetics/vioplotx/master/vignettes/violin_ylog.html

* Split violins to directly compare paired data.

## Functionality

vioplotx works in much the same manner as vioplot:

* `vioplotx::vioplotx()` generates a violin plot takes the same arguments as `vioplotx::vioplotx()` to plot a violin for each group of variables.

* `vioplotx::vioplotx()` also takes additional arguments to specify `main`, `sub`, `xlab`, and `ylab` as used in `plot` or `title`

* `vioplotx::vioplotx()` can take vectorised forms of colour variables `col`, `border`, and `rectCol` to modify the colours separately for each violin respectively. This also applies to a new variable `lineCol` to modify the colour of the boxplots. 

* `vioplotx::vioplotx.formula()` is enabled to take formula and dataframe inputs as used for boxplot and stats operations.

* additional `areaEqual`, `plotCentre` and `side` options enables further customisation.
